== Description ==

Description: One global component for getting the page header out of the way of content. 
Once user scrolls down, header will get out of the way and comes back to check on you once user scrolls up. 
This way you keep the page navigation constantly up close but it doesn't bother the other content.

Prerequisites:

    1.This component is designed to work for only one header element on the page. If page header is made with a div-tag, this component is useless.
    2.This works for sticky headers mainly. If your header remains at absolute location, this component doesn't really bring any benefits.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use Dynamic Sticky Header? =

After activating Sayonara Moder Block Editor -plugin, navigate to the settings menu of Wordpress admin and select 
'Sayonara Modern Block Editor settings' and toggle Classic editor on. 
You can enable modern Gutenberg editor back on again from the toggle switch.

= Why the header remains behind the admin bar after scrolling? =


The admin bar can confuse the operation of the header. You can test the page without admin status, so the header element
can run freely on the page and the plugin should work best.

= Why the header stays the smae even if plugin is activated? =

Some pages or themes build a header navigation with a div tag, 
so the Dynamic Sticky Header plugin does not work properly. 
The structure of the header element can also break the function of the plugin if the header contains many levels

= What about foo bar? =
